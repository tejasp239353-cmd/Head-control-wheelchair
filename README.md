# Head Control Wheelchair

## Overview
This project implements a head-controlled wheelchair using Arduino.
Head movements are detected using sensors and converted into motion commands
for the wheelchair, helping physically challenged users.

## Features
- Head movement based navigation
- Arduino controlled motor system
- Low-cost assistive solution

## Files
- TRANS.ino – Motor control and direction logic
- new_rev.ino – Sensor processing and control logic

## Hardware Used
- Arduino Uno / Nano
- Accelerometer / Gyroscope (MPU6050)
- Motor driver (L298N)
- DC Motors
- Power supply

## Applications
- Assistive technology
- Smart healthcare devices
